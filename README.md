ðŸ”Ž This is an app where you can create a board and track your progress on the project by adding tasks and dragging them to the fixed "Backlog", "To Do", "In Progress" and "Done" columns.

The boards you view or create are saved in localstorage and reflected in the "your history pages" section on the homepage so that they are not forgotten.

#### :rocket: The project is on heroku: [Live App](https://kanban-board-application.herokuapp.com/)
