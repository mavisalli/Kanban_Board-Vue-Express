ðŸ”Ž This is an application where you can create a project and sort your project progress by dragging its tasks into the fixed "backlog", "to-do", "in-progress" and "done" columns.

Technologies and Tools I use:

 :ballot_box_with_check: Back-end: Node.js => express
 
 :ballot_box_with_check: Front-end: Vue.js
 
 :ballot_box_with_check: Database: MongoDB
 

  
## Development setup

Clone the repository

```
cd desktop
git clone https://github.com/mavisalli/Kanban_Board-Vue-Express.git
```

Then open the project in ide and follow below commands:

Create environment file (.env) for your config information of your MongoDB and change its content like below.

```
PORT= 3000
MONGO_DB_URI=<YOUR-MONGO-DB-URI>
```


Install dependencies and run app server with development mode

```sh
npm install
npm run app
```



Install dependencies & serve frontend for development build

```sh
cd client
npm install
npm run serve
```

To run server and client with one command, first install the concurrently package globally

```sh
npm i -g concurrently
npm run dev
```

Navigate to http://localhost:8080, if you're seeing information page, everything is OK!
